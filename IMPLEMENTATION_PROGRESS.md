- âœ… Created outputs/ directory for generated files
- âœ… Moved generated MIDI files to outputs/ directory
- âœ… Removed .mypy_cache from repository
- âœ… Created GitHub Actions CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- âœ… Added untracked asset files to git tracking

### Medium-term Priority (Testing & Code Quality)
- âœ… Created basic unit test file (python/test_midi_exporter.py)
- âœ… Added test scripts to package.json
- âœ… Added type-check script to package.json
- âœ… Fixed lint errors in test file

## ðŸ”„ CURRENT STATUS
